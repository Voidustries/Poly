![Poly](img/readme/Title.png)

Poly is a web scraping program that allows automatic download of TV Shows from a
subscribed RSS feed. Poly creates a database to keep track of what you already
have downloaded and does not download duplicates. Downloads will try for 1080p
HEVC and then switch to 1080p or 720p after a specified number of attempts.
